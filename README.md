# User Authentication With Express, Express-Session and MongoDB
A simple application with the use of Express-session middleware and MongoDB

## Before you start
Make sure to install the node packages with `npm install`

## Start the application
Start the app by typing `npm start` into the terminal.
Please observe that any changes made to the server files only applies after a restart of the server. 
To speed things up it is recommended to use nodemon.

### To install Nodemon globally
```
npm install -g nodemon
```
Make sure to run terminal as admin (Windows) or with sudo (Mac) if you have permission problems.
### Run app with nodemon instead
To start the app with nodemon, you simply write `nodemon app` in the terminal. Nodemon will restart your server everytime something changes in your files.
